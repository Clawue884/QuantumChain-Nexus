# QuantumChain Nexus API Reference

## Introduction

The QuantumChain Nexus API provides a set of endpoints for interacting with the blockchain network, executing smart contracts, and accessing data. This API reference guide provides detailed information on the available endpoints, request and response formats, and error handling.

## Endpoints

### Blockchain Endpoints

* **GET /blocks**: Retrieves a list of blocks on the blockchain.
	+ Request Parameters:
		- `limit`: The maximum number of blocks to return (default: 10)
		- `offset`: The starting block number (default: 0)
	+ Response Format:
		- `blocks`: An array of block objects, each containing `blockNumber`, `blockHash`, `timestamp`, and `transactions`
* **GET /transactions**: Retrieves a list of transactions on the blockchain.
	+ Request Parameters:
		- `limit`: The maximum number of transactions to return (default: 10)
		- `offset`: The starting transaction index (default: 0)
	+ Response Format:
		- `transactions`: An array of transaction objects, each containing `transactionHash`, `blockNumber`, `from`, `to`, and `value`
* **POST /transactions**: Submits a new transaction to the blockchain.
	+ Request Body:
		- `from`: The sender's wallet address
		- `to`: The recipient's wallet address
		- `value`: The transaction value
		- `gas`: The gas limit for the transaction
	+ Response Format:
		- `transactionHash`: The hash of the submitted transaction

### Smart Contract Endpoints

* **GET /contracts**: Retrieves a list of deployed smart contracts.
	+ Request Parameters:
		- `limit`: The maximum number of contracts to return (default: 10)
		- `offset`: The starting contract index (default: 0)
	+ Response Format:
		- `contracts`: An array of contract objects, each containing `contractAddress`, `contractName`, and `abi`
* **POST /contracts**: Deploys a new smart contract.
	+ Request Body:
		- `contractName`: The name of the contract
		- `abi`: The contract ABI
		- `bytecode`: The contract bytecode
	+ Response Format:
		- `contractAddress`: The address of the deployed contract
* **GET /contract/{contractAddress}**: Retrieves information about a specific smart contract.
	+ Request Parameters:
		- `contractAddress`: The address of the contract
	+ Response Format:
		- `contract`: A contract object containing `contractAddress`, `contractName`, and `abi`

### Interoperability Endpoints

* **GET /interoperability/bridges**: Retrieves a list of available bridges for cross-chain transactions.
	+ Request Parameters:
		- `limit`: The maximum number of bridges to return (default: 10)
		- `offset`: The starting bridge index (default: 0)
	+ Response Format:
		- `bridges`: An array of bridge objects, each containing `bridgeName`, `bridgeAddress`, and `supportedChains`
* **POST /interoperability/transactions**: Initiates a cross-chain transaction.
	+ Request Body:
		- `from`: The sender's wallet address
		- `to`: The recipient's wallet address
		- `value`: The transaction value
		- `gas`: The gas limit for the transaction
		- `bridge`: The bridge to use for the transaction
	+ Response Format:
		- `transactionHash`: The hash of the initiated transaction

## Error Handling

* **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be processed.
* **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires authentication or the provided credentials are invalid.
* **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found.
* **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred while processing the request.

## API Keys

To use the QuantumChain Nexus API, you need to obtain an API key. You can request an API key by contacting our support team.

## Rate Limiting

The QuantumChain Nexus API has rate limits in place to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. The rate limits are as follows:

* **100 requests per minute**: The maximum number of requests allowed per minute.
* **1000 requests per hour**: The maximum number of requests allowed per hour.

Exceeding these rate limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` error response.
