# QuantumChain Nexus Developer Guide

## Introduction

The QuantumChain Nexus Developer Guide provides essential information for developers looking to build applications and integrate with the QuantumChain Nexus platform. This guide covers setup, best practices, API integration, and testing procedures.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Development Environment

To start developing on the QuantumChain Nexus platform, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Software**:

   - Node.js (version 14 or higher)
   - npm (Node Package Manager)
   - Git

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/QuantumChain-Nexus.git
   2. cd QuantumChain-Nexus
   ```

3. ***Install Dependencies**:

```bash
1. npm install
```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a .env file in the root directory and set the necessary environment variables, such as API keys and database connection strings.

# Development Best Practices

## Code Structure

Organize your code into modules for better maintainability.
Follow naming conventions for files and functions to enhance readability.

## Version Control

Use Git for version control. Commit changes frequently with clear messages.
Create branches for new features or bug fixes to keep the main branch stable.

# Documentation

Document your code using comments and markdown files.
Maintain an updated README file that explains the project setup and usage.

# API Integration

## Authenticating with the API

To authenticate with the QuantumChain Nexus API, include your API key in the request headers:

```javascript
1. const axios = require('axios');
2. 
3. const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
4. const apiUrl = 'https://api.quantumchain.com';
5. 
6. axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${apiKey}`;
```

## Making API Requests

Hereâ€™s an example of how to make a GET request to retrieve blocks:

```javascript
1. async function getBlocks(limit = 10, offset = 0) {
2.    try {
3.        const response = await axios.get(`${apiUrl}/blocks`, {
4.            params: { limit, offset }
5.        });
6.        return response.data.blocks;
7.    } catch (error) {
8.        console.error('Error fetching blocks:', error);
9.    }
10. }
```

# Testing Procedures

## Unit Testing

- Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha for unit testing your code.
- Write tests for all critical functions to ensure reliability.

## Integration Testing

- Test the integration of your application with the QuantumChain Nexus API.
- Verify that your application handles API responses correctly and gracefully manages errors.

## Running Tests

To run your tests, use the following command:

```bash
1. npm test
```

# Troubleshooting

## Common Development Issues

- Dependency Errors: Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. Run npm install to resolve missing packages.
- API Connection Issues: Check your API key and ensure the API endpoint is correct.
